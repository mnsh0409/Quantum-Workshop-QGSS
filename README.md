Welcome to the official repository for the **Qiskit Global Summer School 2025 Quantum Workshop**. This repository contains all the labs, exercises, and supplementary materials you'll need to participate in the workshop.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the labs, you'll need to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
* An **IBM Quantum account** for running exercises on real quantum hardware.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd quantum-workshop-qgss
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    We recommend creating a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.
    ```bash
    python -m venv qgss_env
    source qgss_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `qgss_env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The labs typically require Qiskit SDK, Qiskit Runtime, Rustworkx, Pandas, yfinance, and `qc-grader`. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -U qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime rustworkx qiskit-aer qiskit_ibm_catalog yfinance pandas "qc-grader[qiskit,jupyter] @ git+[https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git](https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader.git)"
    ```
    > **Note:** The `pyscf` library, used in Lab 3, can sometimes be challenging to install with `pip` on Windows. If you encounter issues, we recommend installing it via Conda: `conda install -c conda-forge pyscf`.
    
3.  **Set up your IBM Quantum account:**
    For labs that require access to IBM Quantum hardware or to grade your solutions, you will need an IBM Quantum API key and CRN. Follow the instructions in `lab0.ipynb` to save your account credentials. **Remember to never commit your API key directly to a public repository.**
